## Brief intro
<p>Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana form a comprehensive platform for centralized log management, allowing organizations to collect, store, analyze, and visualize log data from various sources in real-time. This enables better troubleshooting, monitoring, and analysis of system and application logs, leading to improved operational efficiency, faster incident response times, and enhanced decision-making capabilities.</p>
